              <h5>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients. I would say Pizza is my favorite food since I was a little kid. I love plain and pepperoni pizza pies. Pizza is very easy to get you can order pizza and also make your own pizza. </h5>
        <h2>Steak</h2>

              <h5>Steak is is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It is normally grilled, though can also be pan-fried. Steak is one of my favorite foods to get whenever I go out to a resturant. There are many different types of steak that somebody could order. And their will always be either french fries or potato to go along with the steak. 
        <h2>Ice Cream</h2>

              <h5>A rich, sweet, creamy frozen food made from variously flavored cream and milk products churned or stirred to a smooth consistency during the freezing process and often containing gelatin, eggs, fruits, nuts, etc. Ice Cream is always a great desert to have after the meal.</h5>
